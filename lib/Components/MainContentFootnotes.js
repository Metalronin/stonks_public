          How does it work? First, it pulls a list of posts from{" "}

          Then, it does its best to parse the <i>primary ticker</i> and
          sentiment score for each post through some fancy-shmancy coding.
          (Don't see TSLA or PLTR on your top weekly DD post filters?
          Boo-fucking-hoo, make a DD post about it, get a thousand upvotes, then
          come back... Why tf is FROG on here? Idk and idc, this thing isn't
          perfect, get over it)... Once all of the stonks have been scored and
          packaged, it drives off like an Amazon Prime delivery van speeding on
          Christmas Eve to go fetch some price tags... The price tag for each
          post is NOT exact. It's whatever open/close price it was closest to. I
          need funds deposited in my bank account if we want minute-precision
          data. Anything that doesn't have a price gets removed. The rest of it
          is just some basic maths that any 3rd grader can do.{" "}

          this is "low-quality" content. I don't blame them. So, basically, I
